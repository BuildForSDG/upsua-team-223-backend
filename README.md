## UPSUA is a universal payment system and a mobile bank, this system aims to solve the problems of access to financial services and increase financial inclusion. It mainly targets people with bank accounts and those who do not have any. With UPSUA any customer or tutor can shop online, withdraw money or deposit anywhere in the world. It thus allows a person living in rural area having only his phone to sell or buy inside his country or abroad, he can thus save and benefit from services such as insurance, and others banking services. The specifics of the project will easily allow it to spread easily in Africa so that we can finally easily fight poverty.

## Why

- them Goal 8 Problem Statement 2 DECENT WORK AND ECONOMIC GROWTH

According to Global Findex and worldbank, only 35% of African has a bank account against 61.5% in the world, only 15.4% of African has formal saving against 27.4% in the world. Worldbank notice that internet and mobile phone has accelerated financial inclusion but this progression is still unequal in many countries in sub-saharian Africa. Having access to financial services is an essential factor to fight poverty. In rural area population still not have access to bank, to saving and financial services other than receive and send money from mobile phone, they can’t make online payment or receive online payment from  product they have sell online.
The other problem is about mobility, the changing of locality or area of work make some banking operation difficulty and sometime, it is necessary to create a new bank account in another bank, this can cause after some period your old bank to close your account or ask client to pay some due. Many transaction or operation like open account, transaction etc., cost a lot for clients, and person in informal sector can’t  open a bank account, can’t have access to financial services because they are in informal sector.

-	Proposed solution

Our solution is a mobile and universal financial service. Our aim is to combine Mobile network operator payment system (or e-wallet), banks services and other finance services provider in the same system, so that any persons with a smartphone or with a simple phone, with internet or without internet can access financial service, can open bank account our make bank operation, it can buy/sell or make transaction anywhere in the world. Another important aspect will therefore be the abolition of fees (or reduction) for a certain category of users, allowing them to better save money, thus promoting wealth creation at home and reducing the number of unemployed. It is necessary with a world where everybody is mobile that our bank account, financial service going mobile with us.
We solve the problem of financial inclusion for those who lives in rural area, for those who working on informal sector, so that they can make any bank or financial operation.
The solution give possibility when you have mobile account for send/receive money from mobile Network Operator, to also open an account to our platform, and our platform give possibily to send/receive money  to/from anywhere in the world, access to financial services(Bank/MFI account, e-wallet, insurance services…).
 The platform will allow user to sell/buy to/from anywhere in the world, deposit/ withdrawal money from anywhere.
